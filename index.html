        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently earning a Geology B.S at the University of 
        California, Riverside, and plan to attend California State University, Fullerton for my M.S. <br><br>

        My fascination with the unique research that takes place within the field of geology is what has led 
        me to pursue a master's degree at California State University, Fullerton. My career journey began in 
        a course called Our Planetary Neighbors: The Solar System and Beyond. After entering my bachelorâ€™s 
        with an alternate goal in mind, I was reminded of my lifelong fondness for geology. From there my 
        education took off, and I was determined to understand how scientists connect experimental data to 
        Earthâ€™s dynamic history. Undergraduate coursework and communicating with educators furthered my 
        understanding of the Earth and revealed paths in my newly established career journey. In addition 
        to my education and networking, I discovered ways to establish a stronger connection between 
        undergraduates and the department through the Geology Student Organization (GSO) while introducing 
        myself to research opportunities. Reaching out to professors about joining on field trips, 
        delivering scientific presentations, and hosting social events gave me the chance to provide 
        for undergraduates interested in the major and allowed me to connect with the department more. 
        This kind of activity and dedication granted me the McKibben/Turner Undergraduate Scholarship 
        Award and travel awards to meetings such as the 2024 Geological Society of America (GSA) Connects 
        conference which allowed me to network with other geologists and further cement my interest towards petrology.<br><br>
        
        After discovering I had an interest in geochemistry and petrology, I reached out to Dr. Patrick Phelps about 
        his research on crystal growth and magma dynamics. My current research that explores the petrologic processes 
        and composition of solid Earth, will benefit his investigations and grant me the opportunity to add thoroughness
        to existing discoveries within the branch of petrology at the university and community level. Despite swaying 
        between possible career paths for most of my life because of my immense passion for learning, I can confidently 
        say that I am now and will continue to be committed to a career in geology. For the first time, I am excited and
        determined to provide research and data that can ultimately make the currently adapting theories we base geology
        on more precise. I plan to utilize the expertise I gain throughout my masterâ€™s education to transform the lives
        of the diverse people of California, the nation, and the world through my exploration of topics in petrology.
        Hence, with a masterâ€™s degree I will support society by contributing my information obtained from research to 
        answer modern questions while continuing to adapt and learn from new insights in the field of geology.<br><br>
        
        From the experience I obtained in the time leading up to my application to the Geological Sciences 
        graduate program at the California State University, Fullerton, I gained the skills necessary to utilize my 
        range of knowledge through participation in research towards diversifying the field of geology. Subsequent 
        to the realization that I desired to pursue a career in geology, I was told by undergraduate counselors it 
        would be difficult to shift my degree trajectory so suddenly and would most likely not be possible. Determined, 
        I then reached out to Earth and Planetary Sciences department faculty and made the effort to enroll in the required 
        courses. To ensure this switch would be possible, I registered for science classes, went to office hours to ask 
        questions, and spent my first summer away from home so I could learn more about a topic I had developed so many 
        questions about. After finally taking major relevant courses, information about the Earth came alongside advanced 
        questions that could not be answered just from the completion of undergraduate level courses. My connections with 
        departmental faculty increased with time and because I was eager to answer those questions, I asked how I can learn 
        more. As a result, I was guided to research. Geologic investigation and exploration in various labs to this day 
        motivate me to constantly search for evidence of Earthâ€™s dynamic history and add detail to the theories that shape 
        the field of geology and our understanding of the world.<br><br>
        
        Every moment I read or review literature on topics within the field, I am reminded of the impact my continuous 
        learning and research contributions have on scientists as well as society. Geology needs active exploration and 
        research, but only that kind of contribution from intuitive people will provide that. So while I acquire an understanding 
        of Earth, I work to provide the bridge the Earth and Planetary Science department needs to reach out to innovative 
        undergraduates curious about the field through my role as President of the Geology Student Organization (GSO). 
        Doing this inspired my goals for the future: to progress this activity so there is increased diversity within 
        the field of geology enough that new research and discussions can happen. This would include but is not limited 
        to cultural, gender, and LGBTQ+ inclusivity spreading from a departmental to a societal level so both represented
        and underrepresented groups can access equal opportunities. Alongside my intense desire to learn and contribute, 
        my goal is to increase diversity in the field thus providing a variety of ingenuitive scientists to conquer the 
        research questions that are still missing detail or left unanswered.<br><br>
